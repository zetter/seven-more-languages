# Lua

## Day 1

Similar to javascript:
+ all numbers are floating point
+ functions can be referenced and defined anonymously
+ variables are global by default unless defined with `local`

Function definition:
```lua
function name(arg)
  return x
end
```

Prefix strings with `#` to get length

Concat strings with `..`

Produce a table (looks similar to a Ruby struct or javascript object):
```lua
{a=1,
 b=2}
```
